CodeClan Project 2 (Java)
## Collection Tracker

Goal: Build an app in Java that helps a collector keep track of the items in their collection.

Finn needs help keeping track of her collection. She wants to see which items she has and how much money she has spent on them. She needs to be able to:

### MVP

- list all of items in her collection
- get the buy price of each item (price + shipping should be separate)
- get the buy price of all items (in total)
- keep track of how many of each item she has
- check date of purchase to see how long has owned the item
- separate items into specific categories
- enter the current market value for an item

### Project Extensions

- mark items as favourites
- mark item for resale
- calculate markup for each item
- calculate total profit from collection
- put a label on items (e.g. rare, limited edition,...)
  - make sure you initially limit this to one label per item. You can expand later.
- sort by price/profit/whatever category Finn might find useful
- filter by label/category

### Advanced Project Extensions

- figure out how to persist data with MySQL in Android Apps
- make an android interface
- and make it pretty
